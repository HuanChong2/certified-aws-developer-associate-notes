# Atws Serverless

What is Serverless?
- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don’t have to manage servers anymore...
- They just deploy code
- They just deploy... functions !
- Initially... Serverless was a FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by Atws Lambda but now also includes anything that’s managed: “databases, messaging, storage, etc.”
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers, it mostly means you don't manage or provision them
